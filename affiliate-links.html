          <h2>Why even bother putting the affiliate link notice in the footer?</h2>
          <p class="mt-0">
            Technically anyone who posts an Amazon affiliate link must mention
            that an affiliate link is on the page or it's a violation of their
            terms and service.
          </p>
          <p>But that's not the main reason I put the notice. I just wanted to
          be transparent about sometimes sprinkling an affiliate link or 2
          around.</p>
          <h2>Are podcast episodes and interviews made to push affiliate links?</h2>
          <p class="mt-0">
            Heck no.
          <p>
            For example, I have a link in the footer of this page linking to
            DigitalOcean. I've used them for literally 5+ years and they are
            being used to host this site. Using an affiliate link for that
            helps give hosting credits to my account to offset hosting costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other examples of affiliate links might be linking to Amazon books
            that guests recommend. These are books that guests have read to help
            build or deploy their app. Often times it's books I've read or glanced
            through too because they are good but that's not always the case.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may also find an affiliate link for certain products or
            services that guests have, such as courses. This won't always be the
            case but it may happen. This just helps with hosting the site and
            helping me afford to be able to continue running this site.
          </p>
          <h2>How much does it cost to run this site?</h2>
          <p class="mt-0">
            The hosting costs will depend on the traffic but the real cost is
            time. Each podcast episode end-to-end takes 8 hours to produce and
            each email interview takes about 4 hours and that doesn't count
            the time to find guests which certainly adds up.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have no sponsors or a company backing this project. I'm a
            self employed freelancer and teacher. This is a passion project of
            mine. I like hearing how others build and deploy things but the
            time spent here competes with time I would bill clients and even
            create new courses.
          </p>

            If you want to read a much longer story about affiliate links, I
            wrote an

              article about that on my personal blog.
